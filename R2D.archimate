    <element xsi:type="archimate:BusinessProcess" id="8ae95a75" name="Charging">
      <documentation>Charging provides the ability to assign costs of an IT Service proportionally and fairly to the users of that service. It may be used as a first step towards an IT organization operating as an autonomous business. It may also be used to encourage users to move in a strategically important direction - for example by subsidizing newer systems and imposing additional charges for the use of legacy systems. Transparency of charging will encourage users to avoid expensive activities where slightly more inconvenient but far cheaper alternatives are available. For example, a user might browse a dump on screen rather than printing it off.

Charging is arguably the most complex of the three sub-processes, requiring a large investment of resources and a high degree of care to avoid anomalies, where an individual department may benefit from behavior which is detrimental to the company as a whole. Charging policy needs to be simultaneously simple, fair and realistic.

Charging need not necessarily mean money changing hands (full charging). It may take the form of information passed to management on the cost of provision of IT services (no charging), or may detail what would be charged if full charging were in place without transactions actually being applied to the financial ledgers (notional charging). Notional charging may also be used as a way of piloting full charging.

      <documentation>is the activity whereby payment is required for services delivered. Charging requires that accounting procedures and systems exist and are set up. It makes a difference whether the organization is an internal service provider, or if it serves external customer as its main business. In the case where an IT organization is an internal service provider (according to ITIL, these are Type I and Type II organizations), it is not necessary to bill for services. Sometimes such IT organizations only allocate costs. If an IT organization sells its services to external customers (Type III organization) they will, certainly, issue bills for their services and generate income which funds that organization.

Charging for services by an organization with external customers is the only way to get funding for the organization, cover costs and generate revenue. But, in the case of an internal service provider it can be seen as bureaucratic procedure, which is true. On the other side, I found that internal charging has several advantages:

It justifies IT resources needed (increased transparency),
users throughout organization use only resources they really need (optimization of usage),
business can plan their cost of operation (which is, further on, included in price charged to their customers), and
IT has better control of its business.</documentation>

2.4.1 Process Overview
The Financial Management process provides the business and IT with the quantification (in financial terms) of the value of IT services, the value of the assets underlying the provisioning of those services, and the qualification of operational forecasting. It includes all function and processes responsible for managing an IT service provider's budgeting, accounting and charging policies and activities.
Key objectives of Financial Management are:
• Establishing and enforcing IT financial controls
• Ensuring compliance with legal, industry, and corporate standards and procedures
Assisting IT portfolio investment decisions by providing detailed business cases as well as financial input for decision support
• Effectively predicting and controlling IT budgets
• Providing the enterprise with operational visibility, insight, and superior decision-making.
The overriding goal of Financial Management is to provide cost effective stewardship of the IT assets and the financial resources used in providing IT services. Primarily this is to enable an organization to account fully for the financial resources consumed by the IT service provider and to attribute these costs to the services delivered to the organization’s customers.
This is accomplished by the categorization, collection and analysis of accounting, contract and pricing data including the following typical cost elements:
• Hardware and software license costs
• Annual maintenance fees for hardware and software
• Personnel resources used in the support or maintenance of a service
• Utilities, data centre or other facilities charges
• Taxes, capital or interest charges
• Compliance costs
• Transfer costs and internal charging by other business units/processes.

      <documentation>7.4.8 Chargeback/Showback Functional Component
Purpose
•  Provide chargeback or showback for internal and external services taking into account service Subscription and Usage information.
•  Break down chargeback or showback based on charge types such as CapEx/OpEx, direct/indirect, fixed/variable, and labor/non-labor, as well as by consumer or consumer groups.
•  Charge for IT services rendered based on the pricing model associated with the catalog item, this may also be implemented via showback (no actual billing or cross-charging), which helps the consumer become more IT cost-aware.
•  Trace chargeback or showback line items to individual cost drivers based on the cost model.
•  Consolidate IT service Subscription (right to use) and actual Usage as the usage may differ from the right to use.

The Chargeback/Showback functional component:
•  Shall provide the price of consuming/subscribing to a service.
•  Can take actual usage into consideration when calculating the price of consuming a service.
If an IT Financial Management component exists, the Chargeback/Showback functional component:
•  Can provide the necessary information in order for the IT Financial Management supporting function to produce invoices or bills for services rendered.</documentation>

      <documentation>Budget plans specify expenses for assets, contracts, labor, and certain configuration items (CIs) for a fiscal period, particularly one in the future. Use budget plans as the basis to compare your actual versus planned expenses.

Budget plans are associated with a budget key and a fiscal period. If you have financial data over several financial periods, make a separate plan for each period.

There are several types of items you can add to the budget plan. The costs of these items are broken down over the fiscal period that you specify for the plan. See Budget items and Budget item breakdowns for more information.

Budget plan expense amount types

Budget plans show these types of expense amounts:

Target amounts: An amount that you set as a goal to reach or a limit not to exceed. A target amount is created for a specific fiscal period and account code combination. When you select the account code and fiscal period for the budget plan, the target amount is automatically populated in the read-only target fields. There are targets for both operating and capital expenses.
Budgeted amounts: A rollup of all the budget plan items, which appear as related lists on the Budget Plan form. Only items marked as capital expenses do not roll up to the amount fields. There are budgeted amounts for both operating and capital expenses.
Budget plan ownership

Budget plans have a single owner, who must have the budget_owner role. Whoever you chose as the budget owner must also be associated with the budget plan's budget key as an owner.

Budget plan parent-child relationships

Budget plans can have one or more sub-plans, which roll up their actual budget amounts to the parent budget plan. You cannot promote child plans individually. Only the top-level plan in a hierarchy can be promoted.

The same account codes can be used for parent and any or all child plans, if necessary. Child plans can also have account codes that are lower in the hierarchy. For example, if the parent's account code is IT finance, the child plan's account code could be IT finance > Auditing Service, or similar. If you have multiple sub-plans with the same account codes, the amounts roll up from all subplans to the forecast.

Changing the fiscal period parent plan cascades the change down to all sub-plans. See Budget owners and budget key owners for more information.

Budget plan promotion

You can promote a budget plan to a budget forecast, based on the plan's account code and fiscal period. The forecast helps you predict the expenses your organization will incur. See Budget forecasts for more information.

Create a budget plan
After you have configured your budget target and account codes, create a budget plan.

Copy a budget plan
You can use any plan as a basis for creating a new plan.

Budget items
The items that comprise a budget plan come from several other applications in an instance, including Asset Management, Project Management, and Configuration Management. This enables you to budget your expenses for items across your IT infrastructure.</documentation>

      <documentation>In Cost Management, task rate cards and labor rate cards capture operating costs by generating expense lines representing the cost of performing a task.

Task rate cards are templates used to define the type of task and the method of calculating the associated costs.
Labor rate cards are templates used to define worker's labor rates when calculating task cost based on time worked.

Name	String field summarizing the purpose of the rate card.
Table	Which type of tasks the rate card applies to.
Order	If more than one task rate card apply to the same task, the one with the lowest order is used.
Active	Check box which determines if the rate card will be actively used.
Summary type	High-level type of expense for easier summary reports. This value will be used to set the expense line summary type field.
Condition	Filter to run on the table selected to determine whether this rate card applies to a given task. This field uses the Condition Count Widget to preview what records would be returned by the conditions.
Task rate	Rate of the task, with a currency drop-down. To add a new currency, use the Edit link.
Use time worked	By default a flat rate per task is defined in the rate card. Selecting the check box will force the rule to calculate the task cost based on the related task time worked entries.
Default labor rate	Defines the default hourly rate to apply to the time worked entries if the worker does not have a labor rate card. Displayed when Use time worked is selected.

      <documentation>Allocation unit records define the capacity and usage of a business service.

Field	Description
Configuration Item	Select the Business Service to define allocation units for.
Total Units	The total number of units of expense available to allocate. A unit is a generic measurement which can represent anything. Should match the cost center relationship unit. What units represent can be recorded in the Unit Type field. Note that using the Total units option may result in unallocated expenses if there are unallocated business service units. Using the Allocated unit option always results in 100% expense allocations.
Allocated Units	How many of the total units are allocated. Populated by script.
Available Units	How many of the total units are unallocated. Populated by script.
Updated	When the units were last updated.
Fields which can be added by configuring the form:
Unit Type	Used to record what the units represent (e.g. seats, licenses, Gigabytes, etc.).</documentation>

      <documentation>Cost centers are a commonly used reference between financial systems and IT. Cost center records represent business entities, and have a related list of CI Cost Center Relationships that measure the cost center's consumption of business services.

Field	Description
Name	A unique name for the cost center.
Account Number	An account number associated with the cost center, if one exists.
Code	A code associated with the cost center, if one exists.
Location	A reference to the location of the cost center.
Manager	A reference to the user who manages the cost center.
Valid from	The date that the cost center is valid from.
Valid to	The date that the cost center is valid to.

Service	A reference to a Business Service.
Cost Center	The cost center to apply the relationship to. If reached through the related list, it should already be related to the appropriate cost center.
Allocation Percentage	Feature not yet implemented.
Allocation Type	A choice list. Should be Units.
Allocation Units	The number of units that the cost center is using. This is measured using the same type of unit used to define the total capacity of the business service in the allocation unit record. This number will be used to update the number of allocated units in the allocation unit record. It will also be used to determine the amount of expenses to allocate to the cost center based on the percentage of business service used versus the total capacity.

      <documentation>For every expense line generated for a business service, the default allocation rule Process Svc-CC Relationships will attempt to process the expense and create allocations for each cost center that is consuming the service.

The amount of the expense allocation is calculated by dividing the number of units the cost center is consuming by the total number of units for the business service. This calculation method is refereed to as &quot;all unit&quot; allocation as it uses the total unit capacity to determine the allocation percentage.</documentation>

However, unlike the other tables in the system, the ECC Queue is normally queried, updated, and inserted into by other systems. Each record in the ECC Queue is a message, either from the ServiceNow instance to some other system (an output message), or from some other system to the ServiceNow instance (an input message) The ECC Queue is the normal connection point (though not the only possible one) between a ServiceNow instance and other systems that integrate with it. It's also the point in the ServiceNow instance to which the MID Server, used in Discovery, Orchestration, and some integrations connect.

          <content>Several cost elements can be used to control your accounting:

Capital costs: Any type of purchases that would have a residual value, such as hardware and building infrastructure.

Operational costs: Day-to-day recurring expenses, such as rental fees, monthly electrical invoices and salaries.

Direct costs: Any costs that are directly attributed to one single or specific service or customer. A typical example would be the purchase of a dedicated server that cannot be shared and is needed to host a new application for a specific service or customer.

Indirect costs: One specific service provision that needs to be distributed among several customers in a fair breakdown. A fair example is the cost associated with a Local Area Network on which every customer is connected. Breakdown could be done using total amount of users per customer or total amount of bandwidth usage per customer to accurately distribute the cost of providing this service.

Fixed costs: Any expenses established for long periods of time like annual maintenance contracts or a lease contracts. These expenses do not vary in the short-term.

Variable Costs: Any expenses that vary in the short-term based on the level of services provided, resources consumed, or other factors. For example, energy costs are variable based on the amount consumed.

        <documentation>Financial Management
2.4.1 Process Overview
The Financial Management process provides the business and IT with the quantification (in financial terms) of the value of IT services, the value of the assets underlying the provisioning of those services, and the qualification of operational forecasting. It includes all function and processes responsible for managing an IT service provider's budgeting, accounting and charging policies and activities.
Key objectives of Financial Management are:
• Establishing and enforcing IT financial controls
• Ensuring compliance with legal, industry, and corporate standards and procedures
Assisting IT portfolio investment decisions by providing detailed business cases as well as financial input for decision support
• Effectively predicting and controlling IT budgets
• Providing the enterprise with operational visibility, insight, and superior decision-making.
The overriding goal of Financial Management is to provide cost effective stewardship of the IT assets and the financial resources used in providing IT services. Primarily this is to enable an organization to account fully for the financial resources consumed by the IT service provider and to attribute these costs to the services delivered to the organization’s customers.
This is accomplished by the categorization, collection and analysis of accounting, contract and pricing data including the following typical cost elements:
• Hardware and software license costs
• Annual maintenance fees for hardware and software
• Personnel resources used in the support or maintenance of a service
• Utilities, data centre or other facilities charges
• Taxes, capital or interest charges
• Compliance costs
• Transfer costs and internal charging by other business units/processes.

Seam Management Authority Matrix
The term seam refers to a connection or interaction between one or more organizations. It could be an interaction between business units, business units to IT Service Provider, or IT Service Provider to IT Service Provider. The seam analysis helps to identify the processes, people and technology required to coordinate end to end management of IT Services.

The following table provides key seam descriptions.
The following tables identify key process activities and where possible, associate activity with process seams and key roles.
The authority matrix below identifies process activities that can be associated with key roles and/or process seams. These relationships are documented in terms of RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed). This table does NOT represent a RACI mapping to the organization or sub-processes.

 2.4.7 Performance Metrics
The effectiveness and performance of the process are measured using metrics-based Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) which support high level Critical Success Factors (CSFs). The CSFs and KPIs below are examples which may or may not reflect actual Key Performance Parameters (KPPs).
     CSF #
Critical Success Factors
  KPI #
  Key Performance Indicators
  1
                    Provide Effective Stewardship of IT Finances
  1
 Unplanned Cost Variance. NGEN must provide the Navy and Marine Corps with improved cost planning to inform DON Program Objective decisions and to effectively use allocated budget. = Total to-date planned budget costs minus Total IT budget
  2
 Cost Performance Index. NGEN will employ financial resources fully and not exceed planned and authorized budget. = Total to-date planned budget costs divided by Total to-date actual budget costs.
  3
 Estimated Year-End Costs. Determine how much will actually be spent at the end of the fiscal year. = Total IT budget multiplied by the Cost Performance Index KPI.
  4
 Variance at Budget Year-End. Determine how much will the NGEN program be over or under its fiscal IT budget. = Estimated Year- End Costs KPI minus the Total IT budget.
  6
 Financial Management Process Maturity. NGEN will execute financial management to a high-level of process maturity. Evaluated as a COBIT maturity process level.
  8
 Number of Financial Reports/Forecasts Delivered Late. The NGEN financial management process will ensure financial reports are delivered on time.
  2
    Maintain Overall Effectiveness of the IT Financial Management Process
   5
 Financial Management Tooling Support Level. NGEN toolsets that support financial management activities will facilitate the high level of process maturity. Evaluated as a COBIT maturity process level.

8
Number of Financial Reports/Forecasts Delivered Late. The NGEN financial management process will ensure financial reports are delivered on time.
3
Recapture IT Costs Through Chargeback for Delivery of IT Services
5
Financial Management Tooling Support Level. NGEN toolsets that support financial management activities will facilitate the high level of process maturity. Evaluated as a COBIT maturity process level.
7
IT Invoicing/Payment Variance. Determine how much of obligated funds were not actually paid out. = Total obligated funds minus Total paid funds.
4
Ensure Customers are Satisfied with Costs and Charges for Services
9
 Number of Changes to Charging Algorithms. Changes to algorithms used to formulate payment for IT Services is an indicator of customer satisfaction. If no changes and customers are satisfied, no changes were needed. If no changes and customers are dissatisfied, changes should’ve been made. If changes were made and customers are still dissatisfied, changes were inadequate or incorrect.
 
 
  2.4.8 Tools Interface Requirements

        <documentation>Budgeting is the setting of expenditure levels for each of an organization’s functions. It is the estimation and allocation of available capital used to achieve the designated targets of a firm.

Budget line items should align with accounting (financial statement) line items, and the structure of the full operating budget should match the chart of accounts (the structure of the accounting system), to ensure effective comparisons between budget and actuals.  A mismatch between budget items and accounting items creates extra work for administrative staff or key volunteers who must translate between the two and risks inconsistencies that undermine the usefulness of financial reports.  Especially for expenses, when accounting/financial statement line items exist without corresponding budget line items, it can result in budget overages or erroneously reported line item balances.  </documentation>
